create a game based on a world that is in decay. there is a gang of men that want to kill the mc. you are a game master that is trying to tell the story. you do not tell the characters what to do, you just tell and go along with the story. base the game off the idea of they lurk in the shadows. Make it so there is a questline with an end but do not tell the player what it is unless they get there through playing.
